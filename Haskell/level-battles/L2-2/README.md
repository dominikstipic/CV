# PUH Level 2 Battle

So you failed your second PUH Battle...

Don't worry yet, there's still hope. This is your second chance.

The rules are the same, tasks similar, the idea the same.

This battle consists of 3 tasks. **You must successfully solve all of them in
order to win the battle.** Every task has a single function in the form of
`lb2x`, e.g. for the first task you have to write a function `lb21`.

The output will be tested both automatically and manually, which means you must
take care of the output formatting (spaces, punctuation etc.)

**Do not change provided type signatures!** They're here to help you. Use them
wisely.

Finally, you are allowed (encouraged, even) to **create helper functions** as
you see fit. However, every helper function **must** have type signatures
defined.

## Deadline and submission

The **deadline** is Saturday, 10 November 2018 at 12pm (noon).

**Solve the battle in a branch named `level-2-2`.** When done, open a Merge Request
and assign it to **your** TA.

More on this can be read [here](https://puh.takelab.fer.hr/PUH/readme/blob/master/markdown/course-organisation.md#submission-deadlines).

## How to

You can use cabal or GHCi.

To use cabal, run

```
cabal repl
```

which will run repl. To reload, type `:r`.

If that's not working for you, run

```
ghci
```

and load the Level Battle:

```
:l LevelBattle
```

## Final note

Although you are not allowed to ask for help in solving the exercises, if you
have any trouble with infrastructure, running repl, or anything similar,
**please ask for help on Slack** (but do it in public channels, e.g. `#haskell`).

# Good luck!
