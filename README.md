# Projects
This repository contains some of the projects on which I have been working on for the past few years. The field with whom I was mostly occupied during these years is deep learning and it's applications on computer vision and natural text. For each project you will find its source code and 

**Mentorship projects**:
* BS thesis - [Convolutional Models for Person Localization in Sport Broadcasts](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~ssegvic/project/pubs/stipic19bs.pdf)
* **The analysis of aerial imagery**:
The seminar where I was exploring the applications of satellite and aerial imagery and usage of the deep learning methods in them. 
I experimented with semantic segmentation models, specifically fully convolutional models, on [Inria Aerial Image Labeling](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/inria-aerial-image-labeling) dataset where the task was to segment houses. The main purpose of this seminar was to explore the literature on remote sensing and to get familiar with semantic segmentation methods and architectures. 
* **Real-time semantic segmentation models**:
I was experimenting with real-time semantic segmentation models which are designed with the purpose to be used on embedding devices. This kind of models are great for experimentation because they have fewer parameters and great inference speed. The goals of this project were to get familiar with multiscale semantic segmentation architecture from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08469) paper and to replicate results. To do that, I created [deep learning framework](https://github.com/dominikstipic/DSLearn) for easier experimentation and learning. This project is still under maintenance.

**Text Analysis and Retrieval**:
* **Are You Human? Detecting Bots on Twitter Using BERT**:
* Link on paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9260074
* the main contribution of the paper is feature analysis for the bot classification task and the creation of the classification model based on the BERT transformer architecture. Additionally, we have included exploratory data analysis of our Twitter dataset and evaluated our model on the gender prediction task in order to compare the difficulties of the two tasks.
